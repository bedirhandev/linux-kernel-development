After finding out the device tree I was in need of the include hierarchy of the device tree. Instead of checking the dts file of the device tree and locate all includes hand by hand.
I have decompiled the device tree into one single file. This output dts file is a compilation of all the include files, the downside is that all hardware adresses, references and numbers etc
in the file are converted to hexadecimal.

The device tree blob that I am using to get the source file is directly from the BBB.
The path to it is /boot/dtbs/4.19.94-ti-r42. With a FTP-client I am connecting to the target
and transfering the blob file to my host machine.

The command to convert a blob file to source file.
`~/linux/scripts/dtc/dtc -I dtb -O dts -o output.dts am335x-boneblack-uboot-univ.dtb`

And vice versa:
`~/linux/scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -o am335x-boneblack-uboot-univ.dtb output.dts`

Now that I have the source file I can start with excercise 7.3.

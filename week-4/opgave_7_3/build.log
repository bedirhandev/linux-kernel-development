In the source file there are 4 leds specified.
The led that I want to add is as follows.

Because the blob file is direcly converted to a source file the values inside
gpios are all hexadecimals.

led6 {
	label = "beaglebone:green:usr4";
	gpios = <0x5a 0x13 0x0>;
	default-state = "off";
};

The edited source file gets compiled to a blob file. The blob file in the BBB gets overridden by the new 
blob file. After the BBB is restarted the BBB now started with the new device tree blob file.

By entering the following command I can check whether the led is added or not `ls /sys/class/leds`.

The outcome:
beaglebone:green:usr0  beaglebone:green:usr2  beaglebone:green:usr4
beaglebone:green:usr1  beaglebone:green:usr3

The last one is the led I have created.

By entering the command `echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone:green:usr4/brightness` I turn on the led.
And with the command `echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone:green:usr4/brightness` the leds gets turned off.

The command to compile the dtb is: `~/linux/scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -o am335x-boneblack-uboot-univ.dtb output.dts

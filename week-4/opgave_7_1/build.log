On the BBB with the command `uname -r` I checked the version of my kernel version which is 4.19.94-ti-r42.
I then downloaded the kernel source file from GitHub to my host-machine with the command `git clone git://github.com/beagleboard/linux.git`.
Now it's time to build the kernel. With the command `cd linux/` I get into the directory.
I cloned the kernel source files from the official GitHub repo and did a check out to the correct version of the kernel with the command `git checkout 4.14.67-ti-r73`.
Because I only needed the modules to work with kernel modules I executed the following command:
`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules`. My BBB is configured to use Hard Floats
that's why I am using gnueabihf and not gnueabi.


To check which device tree file is being used the BBB is rebooted and the device tree that being loaded is watched trough a serial communication.

Result:
